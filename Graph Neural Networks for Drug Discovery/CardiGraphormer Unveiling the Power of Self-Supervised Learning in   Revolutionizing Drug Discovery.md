# CardiGraphormer: Unveiling the Power of Self-Supervised Learning in   Revolutionizing Drug Discovery

## Abstract

In the expansive realm of drug discovery, with approximately 15,000 known drugs and only around 4,200 approved, the combinatorial nature of the chemical space presents a formidable challenge. While Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful ally, traditional AI frameworks face significant hurdles. This manuscript introduces CardiGraphormer, a groundbreaking approach that synergizes self-supervised learning (SSL), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Cardinality Preserving Attention to revolutionize drug discovery. CardiGraphormer, a novel combination of Graphormer and Cardinality Preserving Attention, leverages SSL to learn potent molecular representations and employs GNNs to extract molecular fingerprints, enhancing predictive performance and interpretability while reducing computation time. It excels in handling complex data like molecular structures and performs tasks associated with nodes, pairs of nodes, subgraphs, or entire graph structures. CardiGraphormer's potential applications in drug discovery and drug interactions are vast, from identifying new drug targets to predicting drug-to-drug interactions and enabling novel drug discovery. This innovative approach provides an AI-enhanced methodology in drug development, utilizing SSL combined with GNNs to overcome existing limitations and pave the way for a richer exploration of the vast combinatorial chemical space in drug discovery.
