# Organic Building Generation in Minecraft

## Abstract

This paper presents a method for generating floor plans for structures in Minecraft (Mojang 2009). Given a 3D space, it will auto-generate a building to fill that space using a combination of constrained growth and cellular automata. The result is a series of organic-looking buildings complete with rooms, windows, and doors connecting them. The method is applied to the Generative Design in Minecraft (GDMC) competition to auto-generate buildings in Minecraft, and the results are discussed.
