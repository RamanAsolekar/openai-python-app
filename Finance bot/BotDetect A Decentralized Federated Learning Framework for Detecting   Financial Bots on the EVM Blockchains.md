# BotDetect: A Decentralized Federated Learning Framework for Detecting   Financial Bots on the EVM Blockchains

## AI-Generated Summary

**Key Problem:**
The prevalence of financial bots in decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems poses a threat to network integrity and user trust due to exploitative behaviors, despite enhancing market efficiency and liquidity.

**Methodology:**
The paper introduces a decentralized federated learning (DFL) approach for identifying financial bots in Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchains. This approach employs federated learning orchestrated through smart contracts to detect malicious bot activities, ensuring data privacy and compliance with decentralized blockchain principles.

**Key Findings:**
The decentralized federated learning (DFL) framework enables nodes to train local models on transaction history and smart contract interactions, with subsequent aggregation of model updates on-chain through a permissioned consensus mechanism. Experimental results showcase the high accuracy, scalability, and robustness of the DFL framework in effectively detecting financial bots across distributed blockchain networks.

**Conclusion:**
The proposed DFL framework offers a viable solution for detecting financial bots in decentralized finance ecosystems, addressing the limitations of centralized and rule-based approaches while upholding data privacy and network decentralization.
