# Predicting Stock Prices using Permutation Decision Trees and Strategic   Trailing

## AI-Generated Summary

**Key Problem:**
The study explores the application of Permutation Decision Trees (PDT) and strategic trailing for predicting stock market movements and executing profitable trades in the Indian stock market using high-frequency data.

**Methodology:**
The study focuses on using 5-minute candlesticks for the top 50 stocks listed in the NIFTY 50 index. A trading strategy is implemented to capitalize on short-term market fluctuations by buying low and selling high, without short selling due to regulatory constraints. Various technical indicators and hyperparameters are incorporated, such as trailing stop-loss value and support thresholds, to effectively manage risk.

**Key Findings:**
Results show that the proposed trading bot based on permutation decision tree outperformed the market average and yielded returns higher than the risk-free rate offered by 10-year Indian government bonds. Specifically, the bot achieved a profit of 1.3468% over a 12-day testing period, surpassing the returns of bots based on LSTM (0.1238%) and RNN (0.3096%), as well as outperforming the buy-and-hold strategy, which resulted in a loss of 2.2508%.

**Conclusion:**
The study demonstrates the potential effectiveness of using PDT and strategic trailing in predicting stock market movements and executing profitable trades, offering a viable alternative to traditional trading strategies and showcasing the ability to outperform the market average and generate significant returns.
