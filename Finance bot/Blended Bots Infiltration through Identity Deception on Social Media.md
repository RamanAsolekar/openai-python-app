# Blended Bots: Infiltration through Identity Deception on Social Media

## AI-Generated Summary

### Key Problem:
The study examines differences in the types of identities in profiles of human and bot accounts with a focus on combinations of identities that represent gender role stereotypes.

### Methodology:
The researchers compared profiles of human and bot accounts to identify differentiating identities. They focused on identities related to gender role stereotypes and analyzed the expression of gender bias in both human and bot accounts.

### Key Findings:
- Certain types of identities can distinguish between human and bot profiles, aiding in the identification of bot accounts on social media.
- Gender bias is more prevalent in human accounts compared to bots, but specific identities in bot profiles exhibit strong associations with gender, such as technology, finance, sports, and horoscopes.

### Conclusion:
The study suggests that detecting bots on social media can be enhanced by focusing on specific identities, particularly those closely linked to gender stereotypes. The findings also highlight the need for further research on gender biases in human and bot interactions on social media platforms.
